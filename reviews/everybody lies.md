# Everybody Lies
## Seth Stephens-Davidowitz

This is a worthwhile read. The findings if not the methodology will likely be outdated within 10 years, so read it sooner than later. Stephens-Davidowitz tells a simple story for a general audience. We, in some ways and to a degree, reveal true things about ourselves in our Google queries that we do not otherwise reveal.

Most surveys about self-reported behavior involving sex, drug use, criminal activity, socially proscribed attitudes, etc are suspect. Stephens-Davidowitz claims that queries are more accurate because the search engine is non-judgmental and the user is seeking information about a real experience.

## Findings

Some of the stories confirm our cultural understandings of how the world works. Some of our cultural stories are disconfirmed. These, of course, are the most interesting.

Note that all the findings are preliminary as of the writing of the book in 2017.

### [Sexual Insecurity](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/25/opinion/sunday/seth-stephens-davidowitz-searching-for-sex.html?ref=opinion)
Men and women ask Google about their physical and relationship insecurities. Men are often concerned with their sexual performance duration, their penis size, and whether their significant other is cheating. Women are often concerned by the smell of their vaginas and why their significant others aren't having sex with them.

Both sexes, at least in our current time period, are interested in incestual porn on PornHub and some women show an interest in rape fantasies on PornHub. Here I should mention that the author rarely uses absolute numbers. He reports rates and relative rates compared to the opposite sex. So, don't be overly concerned about the prevalence, but be aware of the existence. Especially because these are taboo subjects.

### [Sexual Preference](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/08/opinion/sunday/how-many-american-men-are-gay.html)
He finds that rates of out gay men seem lower than expected in certain conservative and rural parts of the country, but that the missing gay men reappear in search queries. The same goes for the supposedly non-existent gay men in Iran and Sochi, Russia. Given this data, Seth expects about 5% of men to be gay. This matches a large national survey reported in Charles Wheelan's book [naked statistics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17986418-naked-statistics).

### [Abuse](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/opinion/sunday/how-googling-unmasks-child-abuse.html)
Kids ask Google about dealing with abusive parents, especially in the aftermath of the 2008 recession. This countered previous survey findings that abuse rates were unchanged following the recession, which was surprising. The model is that abuse increases within families under economic stress.

### [Abortion](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/06/opinion/sunday/the-return-of-the-diy-abortion.html)
Women in states with restricted access ask Google about DIY abortions. Note that interest and action are different, so expressing interest in aborting without a doctor present is different from following through on the abortion.

### [Racism](https://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/09/how-racist-are-we-ask-google/)
Racists search for racist jokes or combine a racial category with a strong negative adjective.

## Warning Labels
### Author's Warnings
He has some warnings against how to use big data, and this data in particular, for individuals, businesses, and governments. For example, governments should be extremely cautious about trying to use it to predict or prevent crimes by an individual for compelling statistical and ethical reasons. A good use would allocate resources to a geographic area, such as gay support groups expanding their presence to certain areas or child care services to areas where abuse search terms are increasing. I was fascinated that racist search terms spiked during and after a President Obama speech haranguing Americans to be more tolerant, but a later speech that simply told stories of non-white Americans as soldiers, doctors, teachers, engineers, etc was associated with many fewer racist searches.

### My Warnings
Two obvious pitfalls to be aware of when using this data. First, these queries are not directly measuring the things we are interested in - they are proxies. So, there is risk of conflating what we can measure with what we actually care about. Two, since predictability does not always lead to explanatory theory, we risk a host of misunderstandings, especially related to the cause-effect relationship or the turkey problem (also called the Bayesian Trap). The turkey problem is the turkey who lives a great life with food, mates, and protection of predators, and continues to believe it will live a great life until, unbeknownst to it, a Thanksgiving arrives on  calendar and its life is abruptly ended. Alternatively, it is the fallacy that things that happen predictability happen inevitably.

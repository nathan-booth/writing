Data and data modeling has many uses and can be incredibly beneficial by creating win-win scenarios for society. This book is a review how data modeling is and can be mis-used. Major problems arise, and are called Weapons of Math Destruction, when opaque models are applied at a large scale that do not receive performance feedback and the subjects are ignorant of the model, its affects on them, or powerless to correct inaccuracies.

Big data models use past data to predict the future. In general, this is useful because the past is our best predictor of the future (i.e., the sun is likely to rise tomorrow because it rose all the previous days). The danger is that the past does not always predict future performance (i.e. housing prices will continue to increase).

O'Neil covers misapplications in education, insurance, loans, predatory marketing, healthcare, political campaigning, and criminal justice. I recommend you read each of those sections because they are important for their effects on the shape of society, the ability of people to change economic class, the lifestyle choices people can make, and election results.

O'Neil counsels the creators of data models to develop and adhere to codes of ethics and updates to governmental regulations to reduce adverse affects. Her prescriptions aren't as specific as her proscriptions. Models should be, if not transparent, then semi-transparent, so that outsiders can judge their effects. Models should have a way to receive accurate feedback. Subjects of models should have a means of knowing when a model has been applied to them, what inputs were used about them, and a path to correcting inaccurate information.
